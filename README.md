### 📄 `lesson.md` — *Your First Python Project: Dice Roll Simulator*

# 🎲 Beginner Python Project: Dice Roll Simulator

Welcome to your first hands-on Python project!  
In this lesson, you'll build a fun and simple **Dice Roll Simulator** while learning the fundamentals of Python programming, and even take a tiny step into **data analysis**.

---

## 🎯 What You'll Build

A program that:
- Simulates rolling a 6-sided dice.
- Repeats as long as you want.
- Keeps track of all your rolls.
- (Optional) Shows a chart of how many times each number was rolled.

## 🧠 Concepts You'll Learn

| Python Concept       | What It Means                                                                 |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `print()`            | Display messages and data to the user.                                        |
| `input()`            | Take text input from the user.                                                |
| `while` loop         | Repeat a block of code until a condition is false.                            |
| `random.randint()`   | Generate a random integer (like simulating a dice roll).                      |
| Lists (`[]`)         | Store multiple values (like saving each roll result).                         |
| `append()`           | Add an item to a list.                                                        |
| `count()`            | Count how many times a certain value occurs in a list.                        |
| `matplotlib.pyplot` | (Optional) Visualize your data using a bar chart.                             |

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Instructions

### 🔹 Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

Make sure you have **Python 3** installed. You can check this by running:

```bash
python --version
````

Create a new folder on your computer called `dice-roll-simulator` and inside that, create a new file named:

```
dice_simulator.py
```

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Print a Welcome Message

#### 🧠 Concept: `print()`

The `print()` function is used to display a message on the screen.

```python
print("🎲 Welcome to the Dice Roll Simulator!")
```

📌 Save and run the file with:

```bash
python dice_simulator.py
```

You should see the welcome message in your terminal.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Import Python’s Random Module

#### 🧠 Concept: `import` and `random.randint()`

Python comes with built-in libraries like `random`, which can generate random numbers. `randint(a, b)` gives a random number between a and b, **including both ends**.

```python
import random
```

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Set Up the Dice Rolling Logic

#### 🧠 Concept: `while` loop + `input()` + `random.randint()`

We want the program to keep running until the user says “no”.
The `input()` function gets the user's answer. The `while` loop keeps asking until a condition fails.

```python
rolls = []  # This will store all roll results

while True:
    input("Press Enter to roll the dice... ")
    dice = random.randint(1, 6)  # Roll the dice
    rolls.append(dice)
    print(f"You rolled a {dice} 🎉")

    cont = input("Roll again? (y/n): ").lower()
    if cont != 'y':
        break
```

🔍 **Explanation**:

* `rolls = []` starts an empty list.
* `.append(dice)` saves each roll in the list.
* `.lower()` turns input like "Y" or "Yes" into lowercase for consistency.

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Show Roll Summary

#### 🧠 Concept: `for` loop + `.count()`

Let’s show how many times each number (1–6) was rolled.

```python
print("\nThanks for playing! Here's your dice roll summary:")

for i in range(1, 7):
    print(f"{i}: {rolls.count(i)} times")
```

🔍 `.count(i)` counts how many times the number `i` appears in the list.

---

### 🔹 Step 6: (Optional) Plot a Bar Graph

#### 🧠 Concept: Data Visualization using `matplotlib`

To make this more interesting, let's draw a bar graph showing how many times each number was rolled.

First, install the library:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

Then, at the end of your Python script:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.hist(rolls, bins=range(1, 8), edgecolor='black', align='left')
plt.title('Dice Roll Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Dice Number')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.xticks(range(1, 7))
plt.show()
```

📌 This creates a histogram of your results.

## ✅ Summary of What You Learned

* Python basics (`print`, `input`, `while`, `for`)
* Generating random numbers
* Storing and counting data with lists
* Simple data visualization
* Writing clean, readable code

---

## 🚀 Where to Go Next

Now that you've completed this project, here are some ideas to level up:

* Simulate **2 dice** and show combined totals.
* Turn the game into a **GUI** app using Tkinter.
* Deploy this project online with **Flask** and **Render**.
* Try analyzing other random experiments (like coin flips or card draws!).
